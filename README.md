# Web Store - A Web Store Website

 <br/>


**Web Store** is a modern, user-friendly web store that provides a variety of products from different categories. The website is built with the latest technologies, including MEAN Stack and is designed to be accessible to all. 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This project is a result of my efforts during a 1-month Angular Course. This course has been a valuable learning experience that has prepared me for future projects and opportunities.
