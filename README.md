# Web Store - A Web Store Website

**Web Store** is a user-friendly web store that provides a variety of products from different categories. The website is built with the latest technologies, including MEAN Stack and is designed to be accessible to all. 

This project is a result of my efforts during an Angular Course by [SofUni](https://softuni.bg/). This course has been a valuable learning experience that has prepared me for future projects and opportunities.
